# Lab | SQL Queries - Lesson 2.7 Part 1

# In this activity we are going to do some database maintenance 
# In the current database we only have information on movies for the year 2006. 
# Now we have received the film catalog for 2020 as well. For this new data we will create another table and bulk insert all the data there. 
# Code to create a new table has been provided below.

USE sakila;

drop table if exists films_2020;
CREATE TABLE `films_2020` (
  `film_id` smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `title` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `description` text,
  `release_year` year(4) DEFAULT NULL,
  `language_id` tinyint(3) unsigned NOT NULL,
  `original_language_id` tinyint(3) unsigned DEFAULT NULL,
  `rental_duration` int(6),
  `rental_rate` decimal(4,2),
  `length` smallint(5) unsigned DEFAULT NULL,
  `replacement_cost` decimal(5,2) DEFAULT NULL,
  `rating` enum('G','PG','PG-13','R','NC-17') DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`film_id`),
  CONSTRAINT FOREIGN KEY (`original_language_id`) REFERENCES `language` (`language_id`) ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE CASCADE
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=1003 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

#We have just one item for each film, and all will be placed in the new table. 
# For 2020, the rental duration will be 3 days, with an offer price of `2.99€` and a replacement cost of `8.99€` 
# (these are all fixed values for all movies for this year). 
# The catalog is in a CSV file named **films_2020.csv** that can be found at `files_for_lab` folder.

### Instructions

# - Add the new films to the database.
# - Update information on `rental_duration`, `rental_rate`, and `replacement_cost`.

### Hint
# You might have to use the following commands to set bulk import option to `ON`:
show variables like 'local_infile';
set global local_infile = 1;

# - If bulk import gives an unexpected error, you can also use the `data_import_wizard` to insert data into the new table.

# - Add the new films to the database.
load data local infile 'C:\\Users\\OMEN\\Documents\\Data\\sols_lab_da23\\lab-sql-queries-2.7\\files_for_part1\\films_2020.csv' -- provide the complete path of the file
into table films_2020

#You might not see the results right away. 
#You might have to click on another table and then click back on the films_2020 to see the changes implemented. 
#This is one way to refresh the table. You can also use the refresh button to see the changes.
#You can also run the instruction
select * from films_2020;
#to check if the data was updated

# Lab | SQL Queries - Lesson 2.7 Part 2

# In this lab, you will be using the [Sakila](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/) database of movie rentals. You have been using this database for a couple labs already, but if you need to get the data again, refer to the official [installation link](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-installation.html).

# The database is structured as follows:
# ![DB schema](https://education-team-2020.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/data-analytics/database-sakila-schema.png)

### Instructions

#1. In the table actor, what last names are not repeated? For example if you would sort the data in the table actor by last_name, 
#you would see that there is Christian Arkoyd, Kirsten Arkoyd, and Debbie Arkoyd. 
#These three actors have the same last name. So we do not want to include this last name in our output. 
#Last name "Astaire" is present only one time with actor "Angelina Astaire", hence we would want this in our output list. 
select last_name from sakila.actor
group by last_name
having count(*) = 1;

#2. Which last names appear more than once? We would use the same logic as in the previous question but this time we want to include 
# the last names of the actors where the last name was present more than once
select last_name from sakila.actor
group by last_name
having count(*) > 1;

#3. Using the rental table, find out how many rentals were processed by each employee.
select staff_id, count(*) from sakila.rental
group by staff_id;

#4. Using the film table, find out how many films were released.
select release_year, count(*) as num_films from sakila.film
group by release_year
order by release_year;

#4. NEW QUESTION: Using the film table, find out how many films have a replacement cost over 25.
select replacement_cost,count(*) from sakila.film
group by replacement_cost
having replacement_cost>25;

#5. Using the film table, find out how many films there are of each rating.
select rating, count(*) as num_films from sakila.film
group by rating;

#6. What is the mean length of the film for each rating type. Round off the average lengths to two decimal places 
select rating, round(avg(length),2) as avg_duration from sakila.film
group by rating
order by avg_duration desc;

#7. Which kind of movies (rating) have a mean duration of more than two hours?
select rating, round(avg(length),2) as avg_duration from sakila.film
group by rating
having avg_duration > 120
order by avg_duration desc;
