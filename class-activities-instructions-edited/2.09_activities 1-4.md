# 2.09 Activity 1

In this activity, we will be using the table `district` from the `bank` database and according to the description for the different columns:

1. Create the connection between SQL and Python and extract all the information from the `loan` table where the status is either `A` or `B`.
2. Use the _executable class_ to run the query/queries. You can test the query/queries in SequelPro or Workbench and then use them with Python.


# 2.09 Activity 2

Pick any two queries from the queries that we have written so far and execute them in Python. The objective is to retrieve the data into a dataframe.


# 2.09 Activity 3

- Analyze transformed data. Hint: graphs are one your options

  - How many new columns have been created?

# 2.09 Activity 4

Understand the confusion matrix. Discuss the type 1 and 2 errors. Which one are we making? Which one is worse in our scenario?

Try `normalize : {'true', 'pred', 'all'}, default=None`. Normalizes confusion matrix over the true (rows), predicted (columns) conditions or all the population.
